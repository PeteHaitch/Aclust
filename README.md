# `Aclust`

__`Aclust` is not my own work__.

This repository is merely a copy of the `Aclust` R package developed by Tamar Sofer. This version of `Aclust` was downloaded on 30 April, 2014 from [http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tamar-sofer/packages/](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tamar-sofer/packages/). 

For full details of the method, please see the paper [`Sofer, T., Schifano, E. D., Hoppin, J. A., Hou, L., & Baccarelli, A. A. (2013). A-clustering: a novel method for the detection of co-regulated methylation regions, and regions associated with exposure. Bioinformatics, 29(22), 2884-2891.`](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23990415).
